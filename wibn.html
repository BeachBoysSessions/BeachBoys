Here are the relevant Brian quotes: 

 

In the premier issue of "Break Away with Brian Wilson" (Summer 1996), which was the BW fan club newsletter, there was an "Ask Brian" corner. Someone wrote and asked, "What is the instrument that starts 'Wouldn't It Be Nice'?" Brian's reply was, "It's two guitars - one played high up on the neck and the other one played regular." 

 

In issue No. 4 (Fall 1997), he wrote little notes to many of the musicians who played on "Pet Sounds". For Barney Kessel, he wrote, "Thank you for your happy guitar on 'Wouldn't It Be Nice'. It brought a kind of ring-a-ding sound. It gives people a boost, a real good boost." Barney was still alive at the time. Based on this, I would be inclined to credit Barney with the dominant guitar part in the intro...whatever kind of guitar it may have been! 

 

From the box set book, Brian on musicians - 

Barney Kessel: "Wow, he was dynamite. Just a really amazing guitar player; that guy was dynamite. He played the introduction on 'Wouldn't It Be Nice'. Whew! Jazz guitar, any kind of guitar you want, he could play." 

 

"On the intro I had Barney Kessel playing this really great guitar he had, a one-of-a-kind twelve-string mando-guitar built by Gibson.  It sounded like nothing else.  He played right into the board."
